LeagueProfiles
==============

Really basic app to create and manage profiles(Keybinding, Hud and game settings) when there are several players using that one pc.

Did this in like nothing, it is basic and dumb written Java.

It hay have a few problems with using buttons in certain contitions since I did not spend a lot of time checking every case.

**Usage:**

1. Locate LoL directory.
2. Make sure the game has your settings, then save.
3. If someone changes setting after that, you can just open and use your profile.
